# Minesweeper(v6.66)
Taken from GroupDiv/Minesweeper, this new version, improves UI, program efficency, 
gameplay experience, code functionality, battery life, CPU cycle reduction, and enjoying the time with your friends
outdoors grilling a burger whilst having an ice cold beverage.

Made with love by Adam Wallace, Alex Whittman, BoHui Lu, Teddy Kahwaji, and Miller Bath.
